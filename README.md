# Internship Showcase
A demonstration of my capabilities regarding computational programming.

## Diffraction Grating Project
This was a second year computing project that helped develop my proficiency using data analyst tools, such as curve-fitting and goodness-of-fit tests, to ultimately successfuly attribute the correct diffraction pattern to the right diffraction grating aperture. It provided a good position to start learning more data analysis skills.

The relevant files are labelled '***py22mat.py***' and '***Report.pdf***'

## Laser Refraction
A simple demonstration of Snell's Law and refraction in python.

The relevant file is '***Demonstration.py***'

## Euler's Methods
Using Euler's methods for numerical differentiation of a function, I show how to propogate a Gaussian function forward in time.
